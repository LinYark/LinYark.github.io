    My research interest is to <strong>simulate the imaging process of optical lens to correct the downstream focusing task</strong>.
    <br>
    Our research team is exploring various possibilities for achieving high-resolution and large-field ophthalmic surgeries.
    This is also the significance of my research on the optical lens.
